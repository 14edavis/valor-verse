# ValorVerse

Welcome to ValorVerse, a software project aimed at assisting story writers for the volunteer project "Stories Behind the Stars" in writing accurate and compelling stories about WWII fallen based off of provided research.

## Dependencies

ValorVerse relies on the openai library to function properly.

## Getting Started

To use ValorVerse, each user needs to obtain their own API key and save it in a file called secret.config. A sample file called sample_secret.config has been provided for reference.

## How it Works

ValorVerse uses the power of openai to generate text based on the provided research about a WWII fallen soldier. The generated text can then be used by story writers to create a compelling story about the soldier's life and sacrifice.

## Conclusion

Thank you for considering ValorVerse for your story writing needs. We hope that our software can assist you in creating meaningful and accurate stories about the brave men and women who fought for our freedom during WWII.
