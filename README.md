## How It Works

To use ValorVerse, follow these instructions:
1. Obtain your own API key and save it in a file called secret.config. For a sample, see sample_secret.config.
2. Create a file called 'research.txt' and copy and paste relevant research into it.
3. Run the program.
4. The story will be saved to 'output.txt'. If you like a story, save it elsewhere so it doesn't get overwritten.
